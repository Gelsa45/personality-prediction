# 🧠 Personality Prediction using SVM

This project predicts a user's **MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)** personality type based on their textual data using an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model. It aims to provide a basic machine learning approach to psychological profiling and can be extended for career recommendations or social media analysis.

## 🔍 Overview

The MBTI personality types are a popular framework consisting of 16 personality types, classified based on four dichotomies:

- **Introversion (I) / Extraversion (E)**
- **Intuition (N) / Sensing (S)**
- **Thinking (T) / Feeling (F)**
- **Judging (J) / Perceiving (P)**

This model predicts the full 4-letter MBTI type (e.g., INFP, ESTJ) using natural language text and SVM classification.
